# classroom-note-app

Product Overview

We are developing a mobile application designed to facilitate the sharing and exchange of classroom notes among students. The app will enable users to upload, categorize, and access notes from various courses and institutions, promoting collaborative learning and academic support. Targeting university and high school students, the app will help users acquire notes they missed or need for classes they're not currently enrolled in. This will be especially beneficial for revising prior information. Our app aims to provide a streamlined, centralized platform specific to this local university or school, unlike alternatives such as group chats, Quizlet, iCollege/Canvas, and Google Drive.

Target Customers

The primary users of the app will be students, professors, and teaching assistants. Students will be able to submit notes from different universities, rate user-submitted notes, and sort notes by rating or upload date. Users will have access to publicly available notes, while access to privately owned notes will require a request. A key differentiator is the ability to download notes for offline use and course-specific tagging.

Top-Level Objectives:

Enable users to upload, browse, and search notes by subject and teacher.

Include client login and admin login pages.

Structure the app to fit the institutionâ€™s needs and allow peer review.

Technical Details

The app will be developed using platforms like Android Studio for app design and structure, and SQL or Firestore for data storage and access. The technical challenges presented by this project will require various techniques to build and deploy the app, making it an interesting endeavor from a technical perspective.
